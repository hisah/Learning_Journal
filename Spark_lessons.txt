  The following are tasks that simply could not have been accomplished 5 or 10 years ago.
    1. Build a model to detect credit card fraud using thousands of features and billions of transactions
    2. Intelligently recommend millions of products to millions of users
    3. Estimate financial risk through simulations of portfolios that include millions of instruments
    4. Easily manipulate data from thousands of human genomes to detect genetic associations with disease
 We now live in an age of big data 
  We now have tools for collecting, storing, and processing information at a scale previously unheard of. 
  Behind these capabilities is an ecosystem of software that can leverage clusters of computers to chug through massive amounts of data.
    Example of these software systems: Hadoop, Spark, Flink
